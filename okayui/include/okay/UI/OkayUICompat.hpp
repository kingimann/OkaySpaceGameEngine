// Small calls that code written for Dear ImGui uses a lot and that OkayUI did not have: the main viewport, colour conversion, theme
// colours as floats, content-region extents, scroll-to-cursor, window size constraints, and a few "accepted, does nothing" calls so
// ported code compiles unchanged (the same approach as the ignored StyleVar values in OkayUI.hpp). Built only on OkayUI's public
// API: no SDL, no Dear ImGui. Chosen from the ranked list in docs/imgui_port_report.md.
//
// What each call does here, and where it differs from Dear ImGui, is written at the declaration.
